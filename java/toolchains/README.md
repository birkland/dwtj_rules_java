# Toolchain Type Declarations

Subpackages of this package are only meant to declare the various toolchain
types known by this project.

Each of these toolchain types has a corresponding toolchain rule defined
[elsewhere in this project][1].

Some background on the role of toolchain types within the Bazel toolchain
framework is provided [here][2].
